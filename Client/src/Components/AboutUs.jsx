        <p className="section-header">Our Mission</p>
          <p>To develop a comprehensive program of resources, which immediately relieves the burden of food insecurity* for UMBC members and connects them to ongoing support networks, in order to enhance their academic retention and career success.</p>
          <p><br /><em>*The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) defines food insecurity as a lack of consistent access to enough food for an active, healthy life.</em>
        </p>

        <p className="section-header">Our Vision</p>
        <p>
          To relieve the burden of food insecurity and related issues for all UMBC members and provide the UMBC community with ongoing support by connecting them with on-campus resources, such as those within the Division of Student Affairsâ€™s Retriever Support Services and off-campus resources, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).
        </p>

        <p className="section-header">Our Values</p>
        <p>
          We know that having inadequate food resources is a normal part of society and we believe that nobody should have to sacrifice basic needs, whether material or psychosocial, in order to get through college. <br />
          We are a community that operates on the premise that everyone has something valuable to contribute to our organization; we exist in solidarity and reciprocity with UMBC members experiencing food insecurity. <br />
          We are committed to learning from our community by encouraging campus-wide participation and incorporating feedback loops and adaptability into our operations. <br />
          We do not gatekeep. We recognize that financial decision-making is complex and therefore we do not require proof of need to access our pantry resources.
